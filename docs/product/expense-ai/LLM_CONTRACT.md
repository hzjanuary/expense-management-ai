# Pocket Ledger AI LLM Contract

Source input: `docs/product/expense-ai/SPEC.md`

## Core Safety Rule

The LLM/SLM must never write to the database directly.

Allowed flow:

```text
User text
  -> LLM structured extraction
  -> schema validation
  -> business rule validation
  -> optional confirmation or clarification
  -> command handler
  -> database transaction
  -> recalculated dashboard totals
```

## Supported MVP Intents

- `create_transaction`
- `query_spending`
- `budget_remaining`
- `spending_breakdown`
- `set_budget`
- `unknown`

Post-MVP intents:

- `update_transaction`
- `delete_transaction`
- `create_recurring_transaction`
- `import_transactions`
- `export_report`

## Structured Output Schema

Transaction parse output:

```json
{
  "intent": "create_transaction",
  "transaction_type": "expense",
  "amount_minor": 35000,
  "currency": "VND",
  "category_slug": "food",
  "description": "ăn trưa",
  "merchant": null,
  "occurred_at_text": "hôm nay",
  "occurred_at_iso": null,
  "date_range_label": null,
  "needs_confirmation": false,
  "confidence": "high",
  "missing_fields": []
}
```

Expected enum values:

- `intent`: `create_transaction`, `query_spending`, `budget_remaining`, `spending_breakdown`, `set_budget`, `unknown`
- `transaction_type`: `expense`, `income`, `transfer`
- `confidence`: `high`, `medium`, `low`

## Provider Interface Expectations

- Provider calls return structured JSON only.
- Provider errors are normalized before reaching application logic.
- Provider health/status is available to the API.
- Provider endpoint URL and model name are configurable.
- Provider timeout is configurable.
- Tests can use a fake provider.
- Ollama is the first MVP provider.
- llama.cpp-compatible providers may be added later behind the same interface.

Provider interface:

```python
class LlmProvider(Protocol):
    async def parse_transaction_text(
        self,
        request: TransactionParseRequest,
    ) -> TransactionParseResult:
        ...

    async def get_status(self) -> LlmProviderStatus:
        ...
```

`TransactionParseRequest` minimum fields:

- `message`
- `locale`, default `vi-VN`
- `default_currency`, default `VND`
- `timezone`, default `Asia/Ho_Chi_Minh`

`LlmProviderStatus` minimum fields:

- `provider_name`
- `model_name`
- `available`
- `reason`

Normalized provider errors:

- `LlmProviderError`
- `LlmProviderUnavailableError`
- `LlmProviderTimeoutError`
- `LlmProviderInvalidResponseError`

Ollama adapter behavior:

- Disabled by default through `POCKET_LEDGER_OLLAMA_ENABLED=false`.
- Uses the local chat endpoint with `stream=false`.
- Sends `TransactionParseResult.model_json_schema()` through the Ollama `format` field.
- Uses `temperature=0`.
- Validates `message.content` with `TransactionParseResult` before returning it.
- Maps disabled/unreachable, timeout, and invalid structured output failures to normalized provider errors.
- Does not persist parse output or mutate ledger records.

Provider selection for API parsing:

- If `POCKET_LEDGER_OLLAMA_ENABLED=true`, the API uses the Ollama provider.
- If Ollama is disabled and `POCKET_LEDGER_ENVIRONMENT` is `local`, `test`, or `development`, the API may use the deterministic fake provider for local development and tests.
- If Ollama is disabled in production-like environments, the API reports provider unavailable instead of silently using fake output.

Parse draft API behavior:

- `POST /api/v1/ai/parse` returns a typed draft and, for confirmable create-transaction results, a `draft_id`.
- Returned drafts use `source = "ai_chat"`.
- Confirmable create-transaction drafts are persisted locally from US-304 onward.
- Unknown or unsupported input is returned without a confirmable draft.
- Supported relative date phrases such as `hôm nay`, `sáng nay`, `trưa nay`,
  `chiều nay`, `tối nay`, `vừa rồi`, `hôm qua`, `sáng qua`, and `tối qua`
  are normalized deterministically by the backend using the request timezone.
- The parse API must not call transaction creation command handlers.
- The parse API must not create transactions or update account balances.
- Unknown or unsupported input returns `intent = "unknown"`, low confidence, `needs_confirmation = true`, and no draft.
- Provider failures map to safe API errors without exposing raw model output.
- Ambiguous, incomplete, or invalid create-transaction output returns `needs_confirmation = true`, no `draft_id`, no draft, and a deterministic clarification message.
- Missing amount asks for `amount_minor`.
- Missing, invalid, or mismatched category asks for `category_slug`.
- Unknown intent asks the user to clarify intent.
- Complete and valid low-confidence drafts are persisted as pending drafts and still require explicit confirmation before ledger mutation.

Confirm draft API behavior:

- `POST /api/v1/ai/confirm` loads a stored pending draft by `draft_id`.
- Confirmation revalidates the stored draft using deterministic money, currency, transaction type, and category rules.
- Confirmation uses the same deterministic ledger mutation path as manual transactions, with `source = "ai_chat"`.
- Confirmation never calls the LLM provider.
- Confirmation creates exactly one transaction and stores `created_transaction_id` on the draft.
- Confirmed drafts cannot be confirmed again.
- Expired drafts are rejected.
- If a draft has no resolved `occurred_at`, confirmation time is used as the transaction timestamp.

## Validation Rules

The backend must reject parsed output when:

- Amount is missing.
- Amount is zero or negative.
- Currency is unsupported.
- Category does not exist and cannot be mapped to `other` by explicit rule.
- Transaction type is unknown.
- Occurred date is invalid.
- Parsed intent is unsupported.
- Parsed output attempts to mutate more than one financial object without an explicit supported flow.

## Confirmation Rules

The app must ask for confirmation when:

- Confidence is low.
- Amount is ambiguous.
- Category is ambiguous.
- Date is ambiguous.
- Currency is not explicit and user default currency is unknown.
- User asks to edit/delete existing financial data.
- LLM output changes more than one financial object.

Confirmation example:

```text
Mình hiểu là bạn đã chi 35.000đ cho ăn trưa, mục Food, hôm nay. Ghi lại nhé?
```

Actions:

- Confirm.
- Edit.
- Cancel.

## Vietnamese Amount Parsing Rules

The system must support common Vietnamese shorthand:

| Input | amount_minor |
| --- | ---: |
| `35k` | 35000 |
| `35 nghìn` | 35000 |
| `35 ngàn` | 35000 |
| `35.000` | 35000 |
| `35 000` | 35000 |
| `1tr` | 1000000 |
| `1 triệu` | 1000000 |
| `1m` | 1000000 |
| `1.5 triệu` | 1500000 |
| `1,5 triệu` | 1500000 |

Full-message recovery must not confuse times such as `7h` or quantities such
as `2 ly` with money. If multiple plausible transaction amounts remain, the
backend asks for clarification instead of choosing one.

LLM output may extract the phrase, but final normalization must be deterministic in application code.

## Colloquial Transaction Recovery

- Ollama structured extraction remains the primary parser.
- After provider output, the backend may conservatively recover
  `create_transaction` when the original message clearly contains one positive
  money amount plus spending/purchase/payment/transport language or income
  language.
- Recovery may fill missing transaction type, amount, category, description,
  currency, and supported relative date fields.
- Recovery must not convert questions, hypotheticals, budget setup, balance
  statements, or analytical spending queries into transaction drafts.
- Category aliases and item phrases are resolved by backend-owned deterministic
  category normalization. Unknown items are not silently mapped to `other`.
- Descriptions are concise and neutral; informal pronouns such as `tao`, `tui`,
  or `mình`, filler words, and amount text are not stored as the description.
- Examples:
  - `hôm nay tao ăn hộp cơm gà 28k` -> expense, `28000`, `food`, `Cơm gà`.
  - `trưa nay làm tô phở 45k` -> expense, `45000`, `food`, `Phở`.
  - `sáng uống ly cà phê sữa 25 nghìn` -> expense, `25000`, `coffee`, `Cà phê sữa`.
  - `đổ 100k xăng` -> expense, `100000`, `transport`, `Đổ xăng`.
  - `hôm nay nhận lương 15 triệu` -> income, `15000000`, `salary`, `Lương`.
  - `Cơm gà 28k có đắt không?` -> `unknown`; this is not a transaction draft.

## Spending Query Rules

- The LLM may classify a query intent and extract spending scope, category, and date range.
- The answer must be computed from local ledger records.
- The answer must not rely on provider-generated totals.
- Responses must include the amount and explicit date range when answering a query.
- Query classification uses `intent = "query_spending"`, `currency`, `date_range_label = "this_month"`, and an explicit `spending_scope`.
- `spending_scope = "total"` means total current-month expense and requires `category_slug = null`.
- `spending_scope = "category"` means current-month expense for one category and requires a valid resolved expense `category_slug`.
- Total examples such as `Tháng này tôi đã chi tổng cộng bao nhiêu?`, `Tôi đã tiêu bao nhiêu trong tháng này?`, `Tổng chi tháng này là bao nhiêu?`, `Kể từ đầu tháng đến nay, tôi đã tiêu bao nhiêu?`, `Ví của tôi đã giảm bao nhiêu vì các khoản chi trong tháng này?`, `Tổng số tiền đi ra trong tháng hiện tại là bao nhiêu?`, `Tôi đã mất bao nhiêu tiền cho các khoản chi từ đầu tháng?`, and `Chi phí cộng dồn trong tháng này là bao nhiêu?` map to `spending_scope = "total"` with `category_slug = null`.
- Absence of a category phrase must not automatically become a missing-category clarification when the message asks for aggregate, all, cumulative, wallet-decrease, money-out, or total spending.
- If the provider returns `intent = "query_spending"` but omits `spending_scope`, the backend resolves the scope from the original message before asking for clarification.
- Food query phrases such as `ăn uống`, `ăn ngoài`, `ẩm thực`, and `food` map to category `food`.
- Coffee query phrases such as `cà phê`, `cafe`, `coffee`, and `trà sữa` map to category `coffee`.
- Transport query phrases such as `xăng`, `đổ xăng`, `taxi`, and `grab` map to category `transport`.
- Category alias normalization is deterministic backend behavior; provider aliases or labels are normalized before repository lookup.
- Missing, invalid, or income-only categories should produce clarification rather than a fabricated total.
- Unknown category phrases must not be silently mapped to `other` for analytical queries.
- Unsupported date ranges should produce clarification.
- The backend computes `amount_minor` and `transaction_count` from non-deleted expense transactions only.

## Budget Remaining Query Rules

- The LLM may classify a budget remaining intent and extract category/date range.
- The answer must be computed from configured local budgets and local ledger records.
- The answer must not rely on provider-generated budget totals.
- For US-502, query classification uses `intent = "budget_remaining"`, a valid expense `category_slug`, `currency`, and `date_range_label = "this_month"`.
- Food budget phrases such as `tiền ăn`, `ăn uống`, `ăn ngoài`, and `food` map to category `food`.
- Missing, invalid, or income-only categories should produce clarification rather than a fabricated budget answer.
- Unsupported date ranges should produce clarification.
- Missing budget setup should return an explicit no-budget answer rather than fabricated values.
- The backend computes `spent_minor`, `remaining_minor`, `is_over_budget`, and `transaction_count` from configured budgets and non-deleted expense transactions only.

## Spending Breakdown Query Rules

- The LLM may classify a spending breakdown or top-category intent and extract date range.
- The answer must be computed from local ledger records.
- The answer must not rely on provider-generated category totals or provider-selected top category.
- For US-503, query classification uses `intent = "spending_breakdown"`, `currency`, and `date_range_label = "this_week"`.
- `this_week` uses the request timezone with Monday as the inclusive week start and the next Monday as the exclusive end.
- Missing or unsupported date ranges should produce clarification rather than a fabricated breakdown.
- The backend groups non-deleted expense transactions by category, computes category totals and percentages, and chooses the top category deterministically.
- Top category ordering is amount descending, transaction count descending, then category slug ascending.
- Income transactions, out-of-range transactions, soft-deleted transactions, and other currencies do not count.
